Meet with Tarshen Monday 24th May to review Sprint 3 get ready to begin Sprint 4

Meeting with Mr Jiahao 25 May 12:00pm:

For Sprint 4:

- Implement not being able to accept your own job
- Carousel showing top jobs should be based on something specific
- Notifying the labeler if a job is deleted
- Get labeling functionality working and capturing responses 
- Person posting job should define how many labelers can split the job/credits
  and calculate accordingly
- Labeling should occur on the site; keep track of current images that have been labeled.
- Begin labeling on Accepted Jobs page, be directed to new page where we have images
  side to side with available labels and then save responses
- Some type of completion feature (either reached max. no. of labelers or job is completed - 
  some type of timeline?)
