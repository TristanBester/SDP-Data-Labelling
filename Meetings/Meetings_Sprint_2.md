## Sprint Planning Meet 2/Review with Mr Jiahao - 13 April 4-5pm

General PBIs:

- Connect database to frontend 
- Allow people to sign up and login (cater for duplication, unique IDs, authentication etc.)
- Figure out how to upload images to the db 
- Check whether all the images are there (saved) once uploaded as a test function 
  eg. Have arrow key to go through images to test
- Put up different types of labels so people can see what they're looking for 
- 'Other'option if not in the listed labels that you want 
- Once all functionality for images work, we can then worry about labeling other things 
  eg. audio
- Ability for each person to potentially reference their own image folder
- If more time, allow people to upload images and browse things 
- Backend: Potentially store links on Google Drive for all the images
- Credits divided into how many times someone can label an image
- Assignment of credits onto person - when they get a job, subtract from that

## Main priorities for this sprint:

- Allow people to sign up and login (cater for duplication, unique IDs, authentication etc.)
  - Acceptance testing for this 
- Connect database to frontend
Frontend: 
- Create 'create a job' page 
- Create instructional pages eg. How to submit
- Create credit variable 
- If more time, allow people to upload images and browse jobs
