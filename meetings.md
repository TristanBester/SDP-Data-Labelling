## Daily Scrum Meeting 30 March 2021 16:30

Scrum meeting to discuss what we've learnt in terms of databases and Travis CI

Faisal Saleem
- I think we should use firebase, big companies have been moving towards noSQL databases so I think we should migrate towards what th industries are using plus I want to learn some new things.

**Everyone agrees**

Faisal Saleem
- I'm not familiar with workflows but I think that is a method of continuous integration, but not sure so I think we should research.

Langiwe Mwale
- There's a lot of things we need to keep track of so I think we should open up a Trello Board.

Aharon Cohen
- Did we discuss in the last meeting what exactly we were going to use so we could get started.

Ioanni Balassis
- No we just said that we were gonna decide on those based off what the client said he wanted to implement first.

Ghulame Mutjaba
- I added a trello bot to discord (previously discussed that we would use Trello over Taiga since Taiga is not free.

Sipho Sikakane
- I did look at Travis CI and it seems like it's also a good way to manage continuous integration.

Ioanni Balassis
- We also wanted to discuss what is a good time to have all future meetings.


**We discussed a future time to be around 16:30 on Tuesdays and left future meetings to tomorrows meetings**

## Daily Scrum Meeting 31 March 2021 14:00

- Discussed when would be a suitable time for everyone to hold Daily Scrum meetings.
- Sipho: Possibility of using Google Calendar for linked reminders for daily meetings
- Faisal: Not sure between TravisCI and CircleCI, everyone doing research

**We all have a basic idea of how our project will be structured. The tools used will be:**
- Github Workflow (with Kanban-type implementation)
- Some basic form of automation (once base of project is set up)
- TravisCI/CircleCI
- Coveralls
