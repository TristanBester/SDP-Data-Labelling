## Meeting with Mr Jiahao Huo 1 April 2021 14:00

**Mr Jiahao Huo Answering our Questions**
- Web app intially and then transition to a mobile app later on
- No examples that we can compare it to but as long as the user has good experience
- Label Images preferably for now and then later on can add videos and Text etc.
- Predefined options on what labellers want and option for other (Preferable)
- Sign up, Login and Registration and front Page, navigation to jobs (create and view jobs), Shell of what can come in future
- Mainly about Frontend functionality
- Not necessary to separate the accounts from each other, interchangably
- Free most of the week for meeting so just message for meeting
- Thinking about rewards, people can get credits and based on the task there can be a total funding
- Task needs to be finished for rewards can be accepted
- All labelling is done on the platform, show pictures and choice areas, clients must set the predefined labels
- Quality Assurance needs to be a factor (Rating System potentially), Reputation = More Rewards
- Preprocessing by trialing people before they start the job
- Assign Maximum payments on the job descriptions, check that the job has to be done before payments are given
- People with a better reputation get a small extra multiplier for credits

## Discussion
1. Fix product product backlog
2. Fix sprint backlog
3. PBI should have who, what and why
4. To sprint backlog add current PBI’s, also must have sprint tasks representing how things must be done these tasks are distributed between not started in progress and done.

## Sprint Retrospective/Review 12th April 2021 

- Make sure we assign the correct tasks to the right columns.
- For each sprint, only do the tasks that we've added to sprint backlog for that sprint. 
  Leave other tasks in product backlog.
- Any extra stuff we do will be added to product polish.

## Sprint Planning Meet 2/Review with Mr Jiahao - 13 April 4-5pm

General PBIs:

- Connect database to frontend 
- Allow people to sign up and login (cater for duplication, unique IDs, authentication etc.)
- Figure out how to upload images to the db 
- Check whether all the images are there (saved) once uploaded as a test function 
  eg. Have arrow key to go through images to test
- Put up different types of labels so people can see what they're looking for 
- 'Other'option if not in the listed labels that you want 
- Once all functionality for images work, we can then worry about labeling other things 
  eg. audio
- Ability for each person to potentially reference their own image folder
- If more time, allow people to upload images and browse things 
- Backend: Potentially store links on Google Drive for all the images
- Credits divided into how many times someone can label an image
- Assignment of credits onto person - when they get a job, subtract from that

## Main priorities for this sprint:

- Allow people to sign up and login (cater for duplication, unique IDs, authentication etc.)
  - Acceptance testing for this 
- Connect database to frontend
Frontend: 
- Create 'create a job' page 
- Create instructional pages eg. How to submit
- Create credit variable 
- If more time, allow people to upload images and browse jobs
