## Meeting with Mr Jiahao Huo 1 April 2021 14:00

**Mr Jiahao Huo Answering our Questions**
- Web app intially and then transition to a mobile app later on
- No examples that we can compare it to but as long as the user has good experience
- Label Images preferably for now and then later on can add videos and Text etc.
- Predefined options on what labellers want and option for other (Preferable)
- Sign up, Login and Registration and front Page, navigation to jobs (create and view jobs), Shell of what can come in future
- Mainly about Frontend functionality
- Not necessary to separate the accounts from each other, interchangably
- Free most of the week for meeting so just message for meeting
- Thinking about rewards, people can get credits and based on the task there can be a total funding
- Task needs to be finished for rewards can be accepted
- All labelling is done on the platform, show pictures and choice areas, clients must set the predefined labels
- Quality Assurance needs to be a factor (Rating System potentially), Reputation = More Rewards
- Preprocessing by trialing people before they start the job
- Assign Maximum payments on the job descriptions, check that the job has to be done before payments are given
- People with a better reputation get a small extra multiplier for credits

## Sprint Retrospective/Review 12th April 2021 

- Make sure we assign the correct tasks to the right columns.
- For each sprint, only do the tasks that we've added to sprint backlog for that sprint. 
  Leave other tasks in product backlog.
- Any extra stuff we do will be added to product polish.
